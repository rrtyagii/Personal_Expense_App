# Personal Expense App

A new project which helped me learn about Flutter. I am still adding images and gifs of the output to this repository. Additionally, I am still figuring out how to link firebase to with this project to store some existing transaction of firebase database 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
You can clone the project and run on android studio or XCode to interact with it.
